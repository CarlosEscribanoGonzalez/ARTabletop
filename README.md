# ARTabletop

**ARTabletop** is an augmented reality (AR) tabletop gaming application developed as my *Final Degree Project (TFG)* for the Video Game Design and Development Degree at Rey Juan Carlos University.

The project explores the intersection between board games and AR technology by creating a tool that allows users to enjoy, create, and share tabletop games using their Android device and a set of custom AR markers.

This application was fully developed using Unity, and the final version is publicly available for free on [Itch.io](https://karesito.itch.io/artabletop), along with all the required AR markers. The complete Unity project can also be accessed through this GitHub repository.

## About the Project

ARTabletop is an Android application that uses marker-based AR to project virtual elements such as cards, pieces, and boards onto real-world surfaces. The app allows users to play predefined games or create their own using the built-in editor. It also supports synchronized sessions for multiplayer gameplay, both online and offline.

This project aims to:
- Democratize access to tabletop gaming, making it portable and dynamic.
- Provide a creative tool for designing new board games or extending existing ones.
- Serve as a hybrid bridge between video games and physical games, blending tangible and virtual play.
